# Netflix Data Visualization project!
---
This is my cool Netflix Data Visualization project! I took a dataset (netflix_titles.csv) with like ~9,000 movies and TV shows and made some dope charts to figure out what’s going on with Netflix’s catalog. Used Python, pandas for crunching data, and matplotlib for visuals. The goal? Clean the data, find trends, and make it look sick with graphs!

## What I Did:

Cleaned Data: Dropped rows missing stuff like type, release_year, rating, country, or duration. Also turned movie durations (like "90 min") into numbers for analysis.
Movies vs. TV Shows: Made a bar chart to show movies outnumber TV shows big time.
Ratings Pie Chart: A pie chart showing what % of content is TV-MA, PG-13, etc. Looks neat!
Movie Duration: Histogram to check how long movies are. Most are around 90–120 mins.
Release Year Trend: Line plot showing how Netflix content grew over years. Spoiler: it’s a lot!
Top Countries: Bar chart of which countries make the most shows. USA’s killing it.
Movies vs. TV Shows by Year: Subplots comparing how many movies and TV shows dropped each year.
Tech Stuff:

Used pandas for grouping, counting, and sorting data.
matplotlib for all the cool plots with colors like maroon, teal, and dark red.
Saved all charts as PNGs (like movies_vs_tv_showes.png) for flexing.
Had to clean duration data and handle missing values, which was a bit tricky but got it done!
